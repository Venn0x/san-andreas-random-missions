# san-andreas-random-missions
A mod that is randomizing the missions in the GTA San Andreas storyline.
Feel free to report any bugs or crashes. 
When you enter a waypoint, a random mission name will appear and other random mission will start.
When you complete a mission, a random waypoint will appear
To prevent wanted level or interior access bugs, all the cities and interior are open at the start of the game
Please leave credit if you use this in a video / stream etc
