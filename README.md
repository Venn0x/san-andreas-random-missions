# san-andreas-random-missions
A mod that is randomizing the missions in the GTA San Andreas storyline.
Feel free to report any bugs or crashes. 
When you enter a waypoint, a random mission name will appear and other random mission will start.
When you complete a mission, a random waypoint will appear
To prevent wanted level or interior access bugs, all the cities and interior are open at the start of the game
Please leave credit if you use this in a video / stream etc

V2:
- Now, if a mission plays once, it won t play until the end of the game
- The game end when 80 storyline missions are completed.
- After 80 missions completed, the counter resets and the played missions can play again
- Added support for saves

To install:
Replace the main.scm file (from the mod) to: Game directory/data/script/main.scm
